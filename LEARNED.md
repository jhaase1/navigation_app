# Learned

Verified facts about this repo: stack, run commands, architecture, and the
behaviours that have already burned someone. Read this first.

**Admission bar:** something had to be *verified* — a command that ran, a file
read, a failure observed. Not a plan, not a preference, not a rule invented
after one incident. **Cap: 300 lines.** Over it, the least load-bearing entry
comes out the same sitting.

## Where the facts live

| Doc | Holds |
|---|---|
| `HANDOFF.md` | The network setup and the Roland telnet protocol as verified in Aug 2026. Still the record for wiring, IPs, and the ACK/STX findings. Not maintained here — this file does not duplicate it. |
| `docs/learned/verification.md` | The test policy. Which surfaces get tests, which get screenshots, which get neither. |
| `docs/superpowers/runbooks/lane-process.md` | How work gets done: tiers, worktrees, the merge gate. |
| `docs/superpowers/specs/` | Dated design docs. Receipts, not owner docs — they never override live code. |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Maintained for the collaborator's tooling. Shared file; leave it alone unless Daniel says otherwise. |

## Stack

- **Flutter 3.47.0 stable**, Dart SDK `>=3.0.0 <4.0.0`. Verified 2026-08-21.
- Runtime deps are deliberately thin: `http`, `shared_preferences`, `logging`,
  `cupertino_icons`. Dev: `flutter_test`, `integration_test`, `mocktail`,
  `flutter_lints`, `flutter_launcher_icons`.
- **macOS and iOS build with Swift Package Manager. CocoaPods was dropped**
  (`5608d36`) after the Flutter 3.47 migration. Don't re-add a Podfile.
- macOS needs the `network.client` entitlement in both `DebugProfile` and
  `Release.entitlements` or every outgoing socket fails with
  "Operation not permitted".
- `analysis_options.yaml` excludes `build/` and the platform dirs (`4cb37d9`).

## Commands

```bash
flutter run -d macos                  # the real app
flutter analyze                       # must be clean
flutter test                          # full suite, fast
flutter test test/<name>_test.dart    # the one file you're iterating on
flutter test integration_test/        # layout + device-control flow
```

## The mock rig — test without hardware

`tools/mock_server/` runs a fake V-160HD and three fake AW-series PTZ cameras
that the **unmodified app** connects to and drives, plus a browser inspector
showing what each command actually did.

```bash
sudo python3 tools/mock_server/run.py          # switcher + 3 cameras
python3 tools/mock_server/run.py --no-cameras  # switcher only, no root
```

Then **Settings → Connections**: Roland `127.0.0.1`, cameras `127.0.0.2`,
`.3`, `.4`. Inspector at <http://127.0.0.1:8080>. Standard library only.

- **Leave the app in Live mode.** Demo mode swaps in `MockRolandService` /
  `MockPanasonicService` and never touches the network, so it bypasses the rig
  entirely and every test against it is vacuous.
- **Root is only for the cameras.** `PanasonicService.ipRegex`
  (`panasonic_service.dart:346`) takes a bare dotted quad with no port, so each
  mock camera must answer on its own address at port 80 — which needs an `lo0`
  alias and a privileged port.
- `127.0.0.2-4` are used instead of the real `10.0.1.10-12` on purpose: aliasing
  the church's actual camera addresses onto this Mac would shadow the real
  cameras if an alias were ever left in place before a service.

## Screenshots of the real app

`tools/mock_server/drive_macos_app.sh` drives the built macOS app
deterministically — `shot`, `click`, `type`, `key`, `bounds`. It pins the window
to a fixed frame before every action, because the terminal steals focus back
after each command and stale coordinates put the click on whatever is in front.

Needs `cliclick` (`brew install cliclick`) plus Accessibility and Screen
Recording permission for the controlling terminal. **Screenshots come out at
the display's backing scale** — a 1200×820 window gives a 2400×1640 image, so
halve image coordinates before feeding them back to the script.

## Architecture

- **Eight `SharedPreferences`-backed stores** — device config, people, positions,
  services, height ranges, operator profiles, preset names, visibility. Each
  owns its own keys and its own `toJson`/`fromJson`.
- **`ConfigBundle`** (`lib/services/config_bundle.dart`) gathers all of them
  into one JSON document and can read it back. Wired to manual export/import in
  `settings_dialog.dart:176` onward. This is the whole backup story today.
- **`RolandService`** speaks telnet over TCP; **`PanasonicService`** speaks
  HTTP. Both have an `abstract/` interface and a `mock/` implementation used by
  demo mode.
- **`preset_resolver.resolvePreset`** decides which camera preset points at a
  person: explicit per-person override first, then a `HeightRange` match on
  height, then null. Getting this silently wrong aims a camera at nobody.

## Known silent failures

These are the reason the test policy draws Class 1 where it does. All three are
live as of 2026-08-21.

1. **A dropped switcher socket still reads Live.** Every device response is
   routed into an empty closure —
   `lib/widgets/multi_device_control_page.dart:325`, `:540`, `:548`, `:555`.
   A failed preset recall is visually identical to a successful one.
2. **Permanent ACK desync.** After a malformed response the command queue never
   recovers.
3. **A wedged camera reports nothing at all.**

Lane 3a now ships the backup status surface: the always-clickable AppBar pill,
its popover, the bounded persisted log, and `BackupController` with its
serialized event fold. Production still has no real backup target until Phase
4. Conflict and adoption conditions are surfaced but cannot be resolved until
Lane 3b. The surface does not yet absorb the three device failures above: the
dropped socket, ACK desync, and wedged-camera bugs are still live.

## Agent setup

The superpowers skills live in `.claude/skills/`, vendored into the repo so they
travel with a clone. The upstream plugin is **disabled for this project**
(`.claude/settings.json`) — it injects a "you have superpowers" preamble into
every single turn, which is noise, and its copies here have Daniel's test policy
folded in. Provenance is stamped at the top of each `SKILL.md`; diff against
`superpowers@6.3.0` (`e4a2375`) before pulling upstream changes.
