#
# The window is pinned to a fixed frame before every action, because otherwise
# coordinates go stale the moment anything moves the window -- and because the
# terminal takes focus back after each command, so the app has to be re-activated
# every time or the click lands on whatever is in front.
#
# Requires:
#   cliclick        brew install cliclick
#   Accessibility + Screen Recording permission for the controlling terminal
#     (System Settings -> Privacy & Security)
#
# Screenshots are written at the display's backing scale, so on a Retina Mac a
# 1200x820 window produces a 2400x1640 image: halve image coordinates to get the
# window coordinates this script expects.
